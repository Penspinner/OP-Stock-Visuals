Please find a description of the code challenge below - we trust that you 
will keep this spec and your solution confidential. Let me know of any 
questions, we look forward to reviewing your solution by next Friday! 

**A valuable visualization tool for analysts to have is a pair viewer that 
allows them to compare the historical prices of two stocks. 

We would like for you to build a prototype of this tool using the 
framework(s) of your choice, provided that we will be able to view and run 
the tool in a web browser on the CentOS flavor of Linux. Please include a 
README file explaining your design decisions, any assumptions you've made 
and instructions on how we can run your prototype. 

Our requirements will be kept intentionally open-ended so that you may 
showcase your creative abilities, design savvy and intuition. At a minimum, 
we request that the tool include the following features: 
-2 text fields labeled Ticker 1 and Ticker 2 to specify the name of each 
ticker. 
-A button to update the tool with prices for the two inputted tickers. 
-Daily historical prices going back 10 years for each ticker (these prices 
can be randomly generated). 
-A price progression chart containing a line plot of each stock's price 
(with one plot using the y axis and the other using the y2 axis for ease of 
comparison visually). 
-A price ratio chart containing a bar plot of the ratio of the first 
stock's price to the second stock's price for each day. 
-A data table with columns for the date, price of stock 1, price of stock 2 
and ratio of stock 1 to stock 2. 

Some cool bonus features to potentially include: 
-Data interaction tools such as panning, zooming, and hovering over the 
data-points. 
-Color-coding the data table cells based on some criteria. 
-Scraping actual stock prices from Yahoo Finance or some other retail 
website. 
-Adding text validation to the ticker entry fields to only accept uppercase 
letters as valid input and alert the user of invalid input otherwise. 

You will have 5 business days to complete this prototype and send an email 
with your solution code. We look forward to reviewing your work!**
